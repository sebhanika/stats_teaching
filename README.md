# Teaching Statistics for Human Geographers

This repository contains materials for introductory courses on quantitative methods designed for geographers. This resource has been primarily developed for courses I teach at Lund University.
It only contains two teaching datasets based on NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions but will be extended in the future.

## Data

The datasets provided in this repository are currently based on Eurostat, and I offer the [code](stats_scrips/) necessary to generate datasets using the eurostat R package. There are two datasets available:
- [NUTS2](data/nuts2/)
- [NUTS3](data/nuts3/)

The data is published as csv files with complementary geojson files if it is desired to make maps in the course. 
There is detailed documentation for the different datasets available here: 
- [Nuts2 Documentation](documentation/nuts2_doc/nuts2_doc.pdf) 
- [Nuts3 Documentation](documentation/nuts3_doc/nuts3_doc.pdf)

I am also actively working on creating a teaching dataset utilizing Public Use Microdata from Eurostat. However, there are some challenges associated with this, and I'm currently assessing its suitability for teaching purposes.
