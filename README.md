# Teaching Statistics

This repository contains materials for introductory courses on quantitative methods designed for geographers. This resource has been primarily developed for courses I teach at Lund University.
Currently it only contains two teaching datasets based on NUTS2 and NUTS3 region but it will be extended in the future.

## Data

The datasets provided in this repository are currently based on Eurostat, and I offer the code necessary to generate datasets using the eurostat R package. There are datasets available for both [NUTS2](data/nuts2/) and [NUTS3](data/nuts3/) regions. There are more detailed documentation available here: [Nuts2 Documentation](documentation/nuts2_doc/nuts2_doc.pdf) and [Nuts3 Documentation](documentation/nuts3_doc/nuts3_doc.pdf).

I am also actively working on creating a teaching dataset utilizing Public Use Microdata from Eurostat. However, there are some challenges associated with this, and I'm currently assessing its suitability for teaching purposes.
