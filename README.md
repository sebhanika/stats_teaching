# Stats_Teaching

Welcome to the repository containing materials for introductory courses on quantitative methods designed for geographers. This resource has been primarily developed for courses I teach at Lund University.

### Data

The datasets provided in this repository are currently based on Eurostat, and I offer the code necessary to generate datasets using the eurostat R package. There are datasets available for both NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions.

I am also actively working on creating a teaching dataset utilizing Public Use Microdata from Eurostat. However, there are some challenges associated with this, and I'm currently assessing its suitability for teaching purposes.

### Instructions

While the instructions for assignments are not yet published, I have plans to make them available in the future. In the meantime, if you are interested in using the instructions for your course, feel free to reach out via email.

### Slides

Key slides, visualizations, and data examples will also be shared publicly, but this will happen at a later date. Stay tuned for updates!
