- Shiny App
- Usefull links and websites

## Dataset Ideas

- IPUMS international (check with using data)
- Historical census data from the US

## Shiny App ideas

The app should focus in teaching basic statistical concepts through mostly visual and interactive features:

- Effect of sample size
- Visualizing a bar plot
- Measures of central tendancy
  - Effect of outliers on the mean
- Measure of spread
  - Stepwise calculation of the standard deviation
  - Relationship between standard deviation and the mean
