## Shiny App ideas

The app should focus in teaching basic statistical concepts through mostly visual and interactive features:

- Effect of sample size
- Visualizing a bar plot
- Measures of central tendancy
  - Effect of outliers on the mean
- Measure of spread
  - Stepwise calculation of the standard deviation
  - Relationship between standard deviation and the mean
