## Purpose

This is a teaching dataset designed for introductory courses in quantitative methods and statistics. It includes a variety of socio-economic and demographic variables for NUTS2 regions. The aim is to create a straightforward dataset with variables that are not overly complicated and are easy for students to understand, allowing them to explore descriptive and simple inferential statistics. It's important to note that not every student may be familiar with the concept of NUTS regions, so explanations about them and their differences should be provided in the instructions.

## Source

The data is obtained from Eurostat through the *eurostat* package. The script for generating the dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/sebhanika/stats_teaching/blob/main/stats_scrips/prep_data_NUTS2.r). Utilizing this script, it should be straightforward to recreate and customize the dataset according to your preferences.

## Data Preparation

All variables are based on the year 2019, striking a balance between data completeness and avoiding unintended developments related to Covid-19. Future updates will be based on more timely data as they become available. If you wish to include the influence of Covid-19, adjusting the script for the desired year is a simple process.

I excluded some countreis from the dataset due to missing data for some key varaibles. Most of them are ETFA or EU-neighbor countries with the exception of Croatia being explided as the only EU country.
